# Radiant - Business analytics using R and Shiny

## Data module

This module is modified to add the functioanility of loading a dataset from the dataset repository from Azure ML.

Look at the wiki pages for dosumentation of the radiant.data code.

I have added "message()" to trace the code.

I have also added comments to make the clode clearer.
